## Native Apps
A native application (native app) is an application program that has been developed for use on a particular platform or device. It is install from apps market like play store for Android and App store for iOS users.
some examples of Ntive apps are
* Twitter
* Instagram
* facebook
* Pokémon Go
* PUBG
#### Advantages
* High performance
* More secure
* Quality assurance despite rating in App Stores
* Gets security updates
* works without internet
#### Disadvantages 
* More time spent for feature update
* High price and long development time
* Complicated and expensive maintenance and support
* Content not seen by search engines
* Support of multiple versions of the application

In the mobile world, there are two operating systems that share almost 100% of the mobile device market: iOS and Android. so the two main mobile OS platforms are Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Native apps are written in the code preliminarily used for the device and its OS. For example, developers write iOS applications in Objective-C or Swift, while they create Android-native apps in Java.

### Tools required
* Apache Cordova
* Xcode
* Appcelerator Titanium
* Android Studio
* Flutter
* NativeScript

## Web application
A web application or web app is a client–server computer program that the client (including the user interface) runs in a web browser.
Some examples of web apps are:

* webmail
* online retail sales
* online banking
### How to Work Web App
The web application requires a web server to manage requests from the client, an application server to perform the tasks requested, and sometimes a database to store the information. Application server technology ranges from ASP.NET, ASP and ColdFusion, to PHP and JSP.
#### Advantages
* Web applications run on multiple platforms
* All users access the same version without any compatibility issues
* They are not installed on the hard drive
* Eliminating space limitations
* They reduce software piracy
* They reduce costs for both the business and user
* Automattically get updates 

#### Disdvantages
+ Required an active Internet connection
+ Security concerns about sensitive private data being transmitted over the Internet
+ Problems with certain websites
+ Limited access to the operating system

## Hybrid apps
Hybrid mobile apps are developed for multiple platforms and behave like native apps. It’s a combination of a native app and a web app.
+ These apps are developed using web coding languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

 Examples:
 + Twitter
 + Uber
 + Instagram
 + Gmail

### Advantages

+ Low cost
+ Slightly faster to develop because a single code base
+ Only one app is developed for all platforms.
+ Launch quickly ater testting app
### Disadvantages
+ Typically, hybrid apps are slower than native apps.
+ These apps are dependent on a third party platform called wrappers
+ Less interactive than native apps
+ Less access to the native operating system sensors.

### Hybrid app development tools
+ Cordova
+ Ionic
+ Framework7
+ PhoneGap
+ Mobile Angular UI
+ Onsen UI
+ Xamarin
+ Sencha Ext JS



#### Which one has better performance and User Experience – Native or Hybrid Apps?

Performance and user experience is a very important factor in the success of any application.
The psychology of a mobile user is straightforward: Users just want to keep using their phone in the way they believe all apps on their phone will operate from a navigational and interactive point of view.
And the application’s controls, interactions, visual cues, and gestures must be seamlessly integrated with your platform’s extensive style guide.
If your app’s user experience and performance are bad, the user will have some sort of a negative reaction to the app like from never using it again to giving a bad review and then jumping on to a competitor’s app.

## Native vs Hybrid Apps
Hybrid applications are a combination of native and web apps. The inner workings of a hybrid application are similar to a web app, but it installs like a native app. Hybrid applications have access to internal device APIs, which means they can use resources such as the camera, storage and GPS.
