# Native Apps
A native application (native app) is an application program that has been developed for use on a particular platform or device. It is installed from apps market like play store for Android and App store for iOS users.

some examples of Native apps are
* Twitter
* Instagram
* facebook
* Pokemon Go
* PUBG
#### Advantages
* High performance
* More secure
* Quality assurance despite rating in App Stores
* Gets security updates
* Works without internet
#### Disadvantages 
* More time spent for feature update
* High price and long development time
* Complicated and expensive maintenance and support
* Content not seen by search engines
* Support of multiple versions of the application

In the mobile world, there are two operating systems that share almost 100% of the mobile device market: iOS and Android. So the two main mobile OS platforms are Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Native apps are written in the code preliminarily used for the device and its OS. For example, developers write iOS applications in Objective-C or Swift, while they create Android-native apps in Java.

### Tools and Framework
* Apache Cordova
* Xcode
* Appcelerator Titanium
* Android Studio
* Flutter
* NativeScript

# Web application
A web application or web app is a client–server computer program that the client (including the user interface) runs in a web browser.
Some examples of web apps are:

* webmail
* online retail sales
* online banking
### How a web application works
The web application requires a web server to manage requests from the client, an application server to perform the tasks requested, and sometimes a database to store the information. Application server technology ranges from ASP.NET, ASP and ColdFusion, PHP and JSP.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fc858278838f2735cbdca341a84da1a2.webp)
1) User triggers a request to the web server over the Internet, either through a web browser or the application’s user interface
2) Web server forwards this request to the appropriate web application server
3) Web application server performs the requested task – such as querying the database or processing the data – then generates the results of the requested data
4) Web application server sends results to the web server with the requested information or processed data
5) Web server responds back to the client with the requested information that then appears on the user’s display
#### Advantages
* Web applications run on multiple platforms
* All users access the same version without any compatibility issues
* They are not installed on the hard drive
* Eliminating space limitations
* They reduce software piracy
* They reduce costs for both the business and user
* Automatically get updates 

#### Disdvantages
+ Required an active Internet connection
+ Security concerns about sensitive private data being transmitted over the Internet
+ Problems with certain websites
+ Limited access to the operating system 
### Tools and Framework
+ Django is an open-source framework for web app development, written in Java
+ Chrome Developer Tools.
+ jQuery
+ Twitter Bootstrap
+ Angular.js
+ Bootstrap
+ ruby on rails

# Hybrid apps
Hybrid mobile apps are developed for multiple platforms and behave like native apps. It’s a combination of a native app and a web app.
+ These apps are developed using web coding languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

 Examples:
 + Twitter
 + Uber
 + Instagram
 + Gmail
 ### How a Hybride App works

### Advantages

+ Low cost
+ Slightly faster to develop because of single code base
+ Only one app is developed for all platforms.
+ Launch quickly after testing app
### Disadvantages
+ Typically, hybrid apps are slower than native apps.
+ These apps are dependent on a third party platform called wrappers
+ Less interactive than native apps
+ Less access to the native operating system sensors.



### Toools and Framework
+ Cordova
+ Ionic
+ Framework7
+ PhoneGap
+ Mobile Angular UI
+ Onsen UI
+ Xamarin
+ Sencha Ext JS

# Progressive Web App(PWA)
A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
+ It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards browser like;   
**Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Microsoft Edge**

Functionality includes working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access, enabling creating user experiences similar to native applications on desktop and mobile devices. Since progressive web apps are a type of webpage or website known as a web application, there is no requirement for developers or users to install the web apps via digital distribution systems like Apple App Store or Google Play.

Examples of **PWA**
+ Trivago Hotel Booking
+ Pinterest
+ Tinder
+ OLX
+ Starbucks
+ Forbes
+ Alibaba
+ AliExpress
### Advantages of PWA
+ Working in Offline mode
+ App-like interface
+ Improved performance
+ home screen shortcuts
+ No nedd to publish apps on apps store
+ Specific hardware features example;push notifications
+ Auto updated
![](https://static2.clutch.co/s3fs-public/push_notification.png)
+ Linkable — Can easily be shared via a URL, and does not require complex installation
### Disadvantages of PWA
+ Missing Out on App Store Traffic
+ High Battery Usage
+ Unable to Access Various Device Features
### Tools and Framework
+ Angular JS:- It is a  tool for developing the client-side part of web apps.
+ Polymer:- It is developed by Google and it is a lightweight Javascript framework.
##### Tools 
+ React
+ Lighthouse
+ Dev Tools
+ Workbox

# Website
A site or website is a central location of web pages that are related and accessed by visiting the home page of the website using a browser.
A website can be made up of a single page or it could have thousands of pages. Each page will have its own text, images and other elements. All web pages and elements are then placed in a folder and stored on your web host server.

Each web page is written in codes and these codes describe the layout, format and content on the page. The most common coding language used to create web pages is HTML. 
+ In this time JavaScript>PHP>Python>Golang>Java are also used for designing a Website
#### What is the difference between a website and a web page?
A website refers to a central location that contains more than one web page or a series of web pages. For example, gndec.ac.in is considered a website, which contains thousands of different web page

+ website as a book and each individual page is a web page

### How a Website works
+ A **website** is simply a collection of web pages of codes – codes that describes the layout, format and content on a page. 
+ The **web server** is a internet-connected computer that receives the request for a web page sent by your browser.
+ The **browser** connects your computer to the server through an IP address. The IP address is obtained by translating the domain name(this part is all done automatically by browser so we don’t have to look up the IP addresses ownself.)
+ 
In other words, in order to display website on the Internet
+ A website
+ A domain name
+ A server

Examples of website: amazon.com, flipkart.com,Google.com,Yahoo.com,guru.gndec.ac.in

#### Which one has better performance and User Experience – Native or Hybrid Apps?

Performance and user experience is a very important factor in the success of any application.
The psychology of a mobile user is straightforward: Users just want to keep using their phone in the way they believe all apps on their phone will operate from a navigational and interactive point of view.
And the application’s controls, interactions, visual cues, and gestures must be seamlessly integrated with your platform’s extensive style guide.
If your app’s user experience and performance are bad, the user will have some sort of a negative reaction to the app like from never using it again to giving a bad review and then jumping on to a competitor’s app.

# Conclusion
### Native Apps Best for
native apps are so specialized and complex, they are best suited for performance and user experience.

It is also a good option if we don’t have budget or time constraints and if our app requires extensive use of device hardware features.
### Hybrid Apps Best for
Hybrid apps are a good option if want to reach a broad audience rather than a specialized user base.

It is also great if we don’t have the time and money to invest in two different native apps.

 ### PWA Best for
 + It is best for making an e-commerce website+app.
+ PWA has the highest reach with companies like Flipkart, Twitter Lite and Starbucks reporting increased user retention rate
